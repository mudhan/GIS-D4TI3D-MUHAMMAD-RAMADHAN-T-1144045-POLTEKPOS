Geographic Information Systems(GIS)
Geographic Information Systems are systems that manage about parts of the surface of the earth as a map but in digital form

Latitude is a line that ran between the north pole and the south pole, which connects between the east and west parts of the earth. Latitude differentiate into two regions: the north or what we call north and south latitude, or what we call the southern latitudes, where the coordinate value in the north is always positive and the coordinate value in the south is negative.

Furthermore, longitude is the longitudinal connecting line between the north and south sides of the earth. This longitude is used to measure the side of the east-west coordinate of a point in the hemisphere. Longitude is also divided into two areas, namely the east longitude and west longitude, where the coordinates are located in the east is always negative, and vice versa which is located in the west always positive. The value of the unit of measure degrees into kilometers at the same longitude as well as the latitude
