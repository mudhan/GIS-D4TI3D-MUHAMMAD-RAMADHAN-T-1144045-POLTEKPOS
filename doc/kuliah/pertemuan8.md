Last week we discussed about what the server folder. In the post I will explain how to install server folder
1. To run the server folder, first run CentOS on a virtual box
2. Next connect the network with the host computer virtualbox
3. After that, go into the root through the terminal
4. Then type at the terminal #install mapserver5
5. Wait until the installation is complete
Furthermore, the installation of Proxy Folders
1. Open a terminal type #install python-pip
2. Then type # python-dev
3. Then type #pip install mapproxy
4. Then type #install Vwsqi
5. After that wait until the install is complete
Conclusion
