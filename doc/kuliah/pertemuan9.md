Geospatial Web Service (GWS) helps users find, access, and sometimes manipulate the data of interest in a dynamic web of distributed network. GWS is designed to collect data once and update or edit them in real time. Many GIS users do not follow the development of tools and standards that facilitate the creation of dynamic GWS to access geospatial data and products. However, non-experts are already deploying GWS built to SUN (Fischer 2009).

Conclusion
Geospatial Web service enables users to access data
