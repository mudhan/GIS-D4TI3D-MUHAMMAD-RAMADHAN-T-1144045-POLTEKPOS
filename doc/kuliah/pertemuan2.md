Spatial Data

Spatial data is geographically referenced data on the representation of objects on earth. Spatial data is generally based on a map that contains interpretation and projection of the whole phenomenon on the earth. The phenomenon in the form of natural phenomena and manmade. At first, all the data and information in the map is a representation of an object on earth.
In accordance with the development, the map does not only represent objects that exist on earth, but evolved into a representation of an object above the earth (in the air) and below the earth's surface. Spatial data types which have two types of vector and raster. Model vector data display, placing and storing spatial data using points, lines or curves, or polygons and their attributes. Raster data model displaying, and storing spatial data using a matrix structure or pixels - the pixels that make up the grid. Utilization of both spatial data model is to adjust the allotment and needs.

Vector Data

Vector data model is that it can display, placing and storing spatial data using points, lines or polygons along kirva and attributes (Prahasta, 2001). The basic forms of spatial data representation is, in the system of vector data model, defined by the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (x, y).
In the model of spatial data vectors, lines or curves (arc or arcs) is an ordered set of points connected (Prahasta, 2001). Polygon will be fully developed if the starting point and end point polygon has a value equal to the coordinates of the starting point. While the shape of the polygon is stored as a set of interrelated list dynamically using the pointer / point.

Raster Data

Places on the earth's surface is presented as an element of a matrix or grid of cells homogeneous. Raster data model display, placing and storing dataspasial by using a matrix structure or pixels that make up the grid (Prahasta, 2001). The level of accuracy of raster data model is highly dependent on the resolution or pixel size of the object on the earth's surface. Entity spatial raster stored in layers that functionality in relasikan with the elements - elements of the map (Prahasta, 2001).
Unit elements of raster data commonly called a pixel, these elements is extracting from an image stored as a digital number (DN) (De Bay, 2000). Reviewing the structure of raster data model is identical to the form of a matrix. In the data model raster, matrix or array is sorted according to the coordinates of the column (x) and the row (y) (Prahasta, 2001).
